    """
    inputs
    
        Nvec = list with a length V equal to the number of independent
            variables. The ith element values are integers of polynomial
            order of the ith independent variable
        x = numpy matrix of size k by V, where k is the total number of
            points in the dataset. The ith column represents the ith
            independent variable values with the rows representing the
            different data points
        y = list with a length of k with the dependent variable values
        interaction = boolean value with default set to False. This variable
            determines whether or not interaction terms are included in the
            fit function. If set to True, interaction terms up the max order
            for each independent variable are included, i.e. if Nvec = [3,2]
            then the highest interaction term included is x_1^3*x_2^2.
            Specific interaction terms can be omitted using the constraints
            input
        sym = optional list that defaults as an empty list. If used, the
            length should be V and each element should contain a boolean,
            True or False. The ith element determines if the ith independent
            variable is symmetric either even or odd, which is determined by
            the order given in Nvec. This will also remove the cooresponding
            interaction terms if they are enabled.
        sym_same = optional list that defaults as an empty list. If used,
            the entries in the list should be tuples with two integers. The
            integers represent the independent variables that the "same"
            symmetry condition will be applied. The "same" symmetry forces
            all interaction terms
        sym_diff = optional list that defaults as an empty list. 
        zeroConstraints = an optional list that defaults as an empty list.
            Entries in the list contain integer tuples of length V. The
            integer values represent the powers of the independent variables
            whose coefficient will be forced to 0 before the best fit
            calculations are performed, allowing the user to omit specific
            interaction terms or regular polynomial terms
        constraints = an optional list that defaults to an empty list.
            Entries in the list contain tuples of length 2. The first entry 
            is a list of integers that represent the powers of the
            independent variables whose coefficient will then be forced to
            be equal to the second entry in the tuple, which should be a
            float.
        percent = boolean value with default set to False. When set to True
            the least squares is performed on the percent error squared.
            This option should not be used if y contains any zero or near
            zero values, as this might cause a divide by zero error.
        weighting = optional callable function that defaults to None. If
            given, weighting should be a function that takes as arguments:
            x, y, and p where x and y are the independent and dependent
            variables defined above and p is the index representing a
            certain data point. weighting should return a 'weighting factor'
            that determines how important that datapoint is. Returning a '1'
            weights the datapoint normally.
    
    returns
    
        a = list of the polynomial coefficients. 'a' has a length equal to
            the products of the n_vec elements plus one.
            i.e.: (n_vec0+1)*(n_vec1+1)*...
        r2 = the coefficient of determination, also referred to as the R^2
            value. A value of 1 means the polynomial given by 'a' fits the
            data perfectly
