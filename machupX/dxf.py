"""

This file writes a .dxf file from given 2d xyy value-splines.
These lines are received as three 2D arrays. one is for x coordinates, one is for y coordinates, one is for z coordinates.
Each x array index is an array of x-coordinates for a spline, to be reported in conjunction with the same index of the y array and the z array.
